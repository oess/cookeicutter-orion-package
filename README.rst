OpenEye Cube/Floe Package CookieCutter Template
===============================================

A `Cookiecutter`_ template for Orion packages containing Cubes and Floes.

Features
--------
* Sets up skeleton of an Orion package containing Cubes and Floes
* simple example Cube and Floe
* Testing setup using `PyTest`_ including working test for the example cube
* Automatic documentation generation (using `Sphinx`_ ) for cubes and floes
* Commands for running tests, building docs, and packaging using `Invoke`_
* Version configuration via storing the version only in the module's ``__init__.py`` file


Requirements
------------
* Python 3.5 or higher. We recommend starting with a clean `conda`_ environment.

* `Cookiecutter`_

* Access to OpenEye’s Python package server, `Magpie`_. If you are a licensed Orion user and don't have access, please contact `OpenEye Support`_. Follow the instructions there to configure access to Orion python packages via your ``pip.conf`` file.


Setup
-----

1. `Install cookiecutter <https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html>`_, usually via running ``pip install cookiecutter``

2. run ``cookiecutter  gh:oess/cookiecutter-orion-package``

    *Note:* running cookiecutter directly against the GitHub repository requires ``git`` to be locally installed. To install without requiring ``git``, download the ZIP file from `GitHub <https://github.com/oess/cookiecutter-orion-package>`_ and run  ``cookiecutter cookiecutter-orion-package-master.zip``

3. After ``cookiecutter`` setup is completed run the following commands to install all requirements and development requirements:

::

    pip install -e .
    pip install -r requirements_dev.txt



Commands
--------


Once all dependencies are installed, you should be able to use invoke to build a version of the package for upload to Orion (the tar.gz will be in the dist directory):

::

    invoke package

Documentation can be built via the following command:

::

    invoke docs

A local webserver for the docs can be launched on port 8000 as follows:

::

    invoke serve-docs

Tests are set up for each of the floes included, they can be run locally:

::

    invoke test

To clean up generated documentation and packaging files, run:

::

    invoke clean

You can also selectively clean only documentation files as follows:

::

    invoke clean-docs




Output Skeleton
---------------

The following directory structure will be created by the ``cookiecutter``, the items marked in ``{{ }}`` will be replaced by your choices
upon completion::
